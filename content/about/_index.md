This page is influenced by two well-known publications:

* The design of the page is influenced by John Gruber's [daringfireball.net](daringfireball.net).
* The content is influenced by [Montaigne's Essays](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3600). 

I plan to use this page to semi-anonymously and semi-publicly reflect on things that bug my mind at any given time. I also want to use this as an opportunity to practice writing.

One of the better photography books I read (saw?) this year was [Domestic Landscapes](https://aperture.org/books/domestic-landscapes/) by [Bert Teunissen](https://bertteunissen.com/). It is such an amazing photography project because each photo puts a person in the center and tells their story through the space they lived in for many, many years. As I was seeing the photos, I kept remembering faded images of the house I grew up in, the houses of the relatives I visited, and the house my grandparents lived in when I visited there the summer after the first grade.

I am not nearly as skilled as Teunissen in photography, but I tried to emulate[^1] his idea a few times when I visited my parents' hometown this past summer. I wanted to have at least a few photographic souvenirs to help me reconstruct those fading childhood memories in the future. I also thought this would be a nice practice using my 24mm equivalent lens because I have been struggling to get good images with it since I bought it three years ago.

[^1]: Perhaps *being inspired* is the better term than *emulating* because none of my photos have the same compositional elements as Teunissen's photos. Plus, many of my photos do not have humans in the center.

***irf*** stands for “innumerable random formations.” 

I came across this phrase in Stephen Greenblatt’s book [Swerve](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393343403), and it immediately felt like a good metaphor for the way my mind races from one unfinished thought to another.

I decided to start this blog because I realized that if I never pause and write down my thoughts, I never actually process them. I never engage with them. I don’t even remember most of them. So, I am not writing this blog for others to read it. I am writing it to aid my thinking. 

There are a couple of stylistic influences that guide the structure of this blog[^1]. The first influence is Michel de Montaigne’s [Essays](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3600). I want to write short and reflective posts without worrying about what others would think if they read these articles. The second influence is John Gruber’s blog [daringfireball.net](https://daringfireball.net). I really like the simple, minimalist nature of Gruber's blog, as well as his quickfire style of publishing, so I want to emulate it here.

In any case, I’m so curious if this will be another random project that I start and forget or if I’ll manage to return here to enter an asynchronous dialogue with my inner self.

If you are not me and happened to stumble upon this page, feel free to contact me at irfdot@outlook.com.

[^1]: Of course, I do not claim that I will be able to write anything close to the literary value of Montaigne’s essays or the journalistic value of John Gruber’s blog. Neither do I draw influence from the contents of either publication.

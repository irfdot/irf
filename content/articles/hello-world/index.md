***irf*** stands for “innumerable random formations.” 

I came across this phrase in Stephen Greenblatt’s book [Swerve](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393343403), and it immediately felt like a good metaphor for the way my mind races from one unfinished thought to another.

I decided to start this blog because I realized that if I never pause and write down my thoughts, I never actually process them. I never engage with them. I don’t even remember most of them. So, I am not writing this blog for others to write it. I am writing it to aid my thinking. 

There are a couple of influences that guide the structure of this blog[^1]. The first influence is [Montaigne’s Essays](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3600). I want to write short, reflectively, and without worrying about what others would think if they read these articles. The second influence is John Gruber’s blog [daringfireball.net](https://daringfireball.net). I want to publish a text-first blog with a simple design.

In any case, I’m so curious if this will be another random project I start and forget or if I’ll manage to return here to enter a dialogue with myself. 

If you are not me and happened to stumble upon this page, feel free to contact me at irf@innumerablerandomformations.com.

[^1]: Of course, I do not claim to write anything close to the literary value of Montaigne’s essays or the journalistic value of John Gruber’s blog.

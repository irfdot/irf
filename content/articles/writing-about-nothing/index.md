From Haruki Murakami's book [*Novelist as a Vocation*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/547926/novelist-as-a-vocation-by-haruki-murakami/) (p.82):

> "When I began my first novel, *Hear the Wind Sing*, I knew I had no choice but to write about *having nothing to write about*."


First things first: I have no <small>*~~`delusion`~~*</small> ambition  to write a novel. 

I want to write more because I discover more and more that the only way I can get in dialogue with my own thoughts is to put them on somewhere tangible[^1]. That way, I can let them <small>*~~`brew`~~*</small> exist outside my mind and return some days later to see what they have to tell me.  

Unfortunately, doing so have been harder than I anticipated. For the longest time, I wanted to write this blog [^2] but I felt <small>*~~`constipated`~~*</small> *stumped* about what even to write about. I am still feeling that way, even more so now because I am going through some dog days. My brain feels like a badly made soup. I throw a bunch of things at the imaginary wall in my mind, but nothing sticks. 

Thankfully, I came across this quote from Murakami. It allowed me to at least write this nothingburger post about having nothing to write about. I am hopeful I have plenty in the tank to write about, but if I cannot scramble anything, I will come back here again and again to write about just nothing.



[^1]: e.g., a sticky note,  a reminder on my phone, an event on my calendar, a physical notebook, telling it to a friend (or even to my therapist), and this blog.

[^2]: For more than three years I have been trying to motivate myself to write a blog like this.

From the [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23470/the-myth-of-sisyphus-by-albert-camus/) by Camus[^1]:


> "You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He *is*, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. **This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth.**"


[^1]: Also from Captain Holt in Brooklyn Nine Nine: "Any french philosophy post-Rousseau is essentially a magazine, you rube." [(Season 7, Episode 6)](https://youtu.be/BzN8tbcCVrs?t=168).

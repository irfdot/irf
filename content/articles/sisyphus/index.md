From the [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23470/the-myth-of-sisyphus-by-albert-camus/) by Camus[^1]:


> "You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He *is*, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. **This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth.**"


It is such a beautiful, soothing thought to know that sooner or later, I will push the boulder all the way to the summit, and get a glimpse of the beautiful view. I made it happen before, and I will make it happen again, and again, and again. Every time that boulder rolls down the hill, I will chase after it and cherish the next opportunity to be back at the summit again.

From the Men I Trust [song](https://youtu.be/rwSp40TBOS8?si=r8qBPsujEwRD61i0)[^1]:

> To be ours  
Like the trees on our shores  
All tweezed  
The cliffs eat away at our knees  

It is nice to experience again, after quite some time, how good poetry stimulates something beneath all the surface-level chaos of my mind.


[^1]: This song is from their 2021 album entitled "[Untourable Album](https://menitrust.bandcamp.com/album/untourable-album)," but I felt compelled to write this reflection after listening to the [live version posted on YouTube last night](https://youtu.be/rwSp40TBOS8?si=r8qBPsujEwRD61i0).

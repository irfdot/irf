From the Men I Trust [song](https://youtu.be/rwSp40TBOS8?si=r8qBPsujEwRD61i0)[^1]:

> To be ours  
Like the trees on our shores  
All tweezed  
The cliffs eat away at our knees  

It is nice to experience again, after quite some time, *good poetry* breaching all the chaos in my mind.


[^1]: This song is from their 2021 album entitled "[Untourable Album](https://menitrust.bandcamp.com/album/untourable-album)," but I felt compelled to write this reflection after listening to the [live version posted on YouTube last night](https://youtu.be/rwSp40TBOS8?si=r8qBPsujEwRD61i0).

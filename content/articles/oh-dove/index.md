From Men I Trust[^1]:

> "To be ours  
Like the trees on our shores  
All tweezed  
The cliffs eat away at our knees" 

It is fascinating how *good poetry* can somehow arrange common words to evoke a kind of instantaneous phenomenological experience that one can't easily articulate with words but feel (understand?) intuitively; like a beam of warm sunlight rushing through a small gap between clouds in an overcast day.

[^1]: From their 2021 album entitled "[Untourable Album](https://menitrust.bandcamp.com/album/untourable-album)," a newer [live version posted on YouTube last night](https://youtu.be/rwSp40TBOS8?si=r8qBPsujEwRD61i0).

[^2]: Of course, I can only experience this in *my mind*, but it is safe to assume that this is a shared experience. Otherwise, poetry would not be a thing at all.
